# Python-3-Codecademy

This is a 25 hour certification course that I completed on February 12, 2024. The course syllabus is as follows:

- Hello World (Get started with Python syntax in this lesson and then create a point of sale system for a furniture store!)
- Control Flow (Learn how to build control flow into your python code by including if, else, and elif statements. Expect to learn all you need to know about boolean variables and logical operators)
- Lists (Learn about lists, a data structure in Python used to store ordered groups of data)
- Loops (Loops are structures that let you repeat Python code over and over. Learn how to read loops and write them to solve your own problems)
- Functions (Learn about code reuse with Python functions. Apply that knowledge to create functions for famous physics formulas)
- Strings (Learn all about the Python string object. Figure out how to automatically create, rearrange, reassign, disassemble, and reassemble blocks of text!)
- Modules (Learn how modules work in the Python programming language)
- Dictionaries (Learn all about the Python dictionary structure and how to create and use key-value pairs in your code)
- Files (Learn how to work with files in an automated way! Investigate the properties of text, CSV, and JSON files by reading and writing to them!)
- Classes (Learn about the differences between data types in Python and how to create your own classes, objects, and interfaces.)
